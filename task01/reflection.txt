The results from my trivial dead code elimination(gdce) and local dead code elimination are stored in gdce.csv and ldce.csv
Source code files are lvn.py, ldce.py and gdce.py. The second columns shows how many instructions are in the file and the
third column shows how many instructions are contained after optimization.
